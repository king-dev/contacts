      The SearchView should have a max width to prevent the dialog from resizing to the
      full screen width of the device. The precise value of the max width is not as important
      because the SearchView can take on a smaller width than the max width, so in some cases it
      will take on the automatically computed width of a dialog (based on the dialog contents)
      from the framework.

    <!--
      This will contain an appropriate contacts list. Add a min height to prevent
      the dialog from resizing too much when the search results change. The activity dialog
      is wrap content for height in the framework, so there is no way around this.
